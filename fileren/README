fileren
=======

A small utility to recursively rename files and directories to a uniform
filename format. Discards all the characters in the filename that need to be
escaped on the shell and lowercases all the letters.

If the path to be changed ends with a '/' character then only the content of
this path is renamed.

Characters replaced:

' ' => _
 (  => _
 [  => _
 {  => _
 )  => _
 ]  => _
 }  => _
 ,  => _
 &  => and
 $  => S
 •  => -
' ~ ' => -

Characters removed:
 \
 '
 ’
 ´
 #
 !
 ?


usage
=====

make
./fileren <path>
